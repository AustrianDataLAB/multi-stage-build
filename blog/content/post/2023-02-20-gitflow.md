# Git workflow for deploying new applications with helm

This change type will occur more frequently. It\'s also one of the
simpler workflows. The use case is as follows: there is an application
that you want to make a part of the cluster. It has a finished helm
chart hosted publicly. The change involves adding a new sub-directory
for the application to the helm-charts directory. This new sub-directory
should contain a values.yml file used by helm to deploy the application
onto the cluster.

``` shell
opensciencelab/
├── bootstrap
├── documentation
├── helm-charts
│   ├── ctforge
│   ├── gitlabrunner
│   ├── grader
│   ├── jupyter
│   ├── jupyterprofile
│   ├── keptn
│   ├── ots
│   └── tekton
├── iaas
├── idp
├── paas
├── sso
└── templates 
```

In this example, we have a sample application called \"pacman\" that is
ready to go. The helm chart is publicly hosted, so we want to add a
custom \"values.standalone.yml\" file in to the opensciencelab
repository.

``` shell
opensciencelab/
├── bootstrap
├── documentation
├── helm-charts
│   ├── ctforge
│   ├── gitlabrunner
│   ├── grader
│   ├── jupyter
│   ├── jupyterprofile
│   ├── keptn
│   ├── ots
│   ├── pacman
│   │   └── values.standalone.yml
│   └── tekton
├── iaas
├── idp
├── paas
├── sso
└── templates
```

Once the changes are complete (meaning tested and documented), stage,
commit and push!

``` shell
<user@adls opensciencelab> (main *)$ git switch feature/pacman
<user@adls opensciencelab> (feature/pacman *)$ git add helm-charts/pacman/values.standalone.yml
<user@adls opensciencelab> (feature/pacman +)$ cat <<EOF | git commit -s -F -
> Short header describing the feature.
>
> The body of the commit message. A short paragraph that documents
> the changes that made. Include specific information about the 
> problem addressed by the changes. Outline the approach
> used in creating a solution. Mention relevant design decisions.
>
> Ideally, changes relate to some specific issue that is 
> already documented on the boards, issue tracker, or has been
> discussed via mail. Link to those issues.
> 
> Closes #1, #2
> 
> It's also fine to link to any useful sources that you used 
> during the process of creating your changes. 
> 
> https://https://wincent.com/blog/commit-messages
> EOF
```

Note that the use of a heredoc is atypical, more commonly you allow git
commit to open up your favorite editor.

An SRE will handle the merge request and go through the process of
creating a new tenant for the application. In the current setup this
happens as part of a job in the pipeline.

# Making changes to a submodule

The opensciencelab repository contains 4 git submodules. From the
perspective of the parent repository (opensciencelab), a submodule is a
reference to the SHA-1 of some other git repository. When you initially
clone the parent repository, the submodules do not get cloned by
default:

``` shell
<user@adls src> $ git clone git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/AOCC/OpenScienceLabs/opensciencelab
<user@adls src> $ cd opensciencelab
<user@adls opensciencelab> (main) $ git submodule status
-73475e6c19196a1af267ee36078a83f630d133db paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher
-8c974cc0352fa6a758556a39714848072939df96 paas/openldap/ansible/openldap
-7d2436fed86aa724e73068b71778ba527867be4d paas/storage/ansible/ceph
-209d26e06a31f355e2ecf9a3f0972bd94eb88e88 paas/storage/ansible/nfsv4
```

The status command outputs the relative path to the submodule and also
the output of git describe for the SHA-1. A prefix of \"-\" indicates an
uninitialized submodule, \"+\" indicates the currently checked out
submodule commit does not match the SHA-1 found in the index, \"U\"
indicates merge conflicts.

## Example workflow: create a new feature in one of the storage submodules

In this example we want to make a change to the ansible scripts that
deploy osrancher. First step is to clone the opensciencelab repository
and then update the submodule for the first time, this will require the
\`--init\` flag:

``` shell
<user@adls opensciencelab> (main)$ git submodule update --init paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher
submodule 'paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher' (https://AOCC@dev.azure.com/AOCC/OpenScienceLabs/_git/osrancher) registered for path 'paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher'
Cloning into '/home/adam/.local/src/tuw/aocc/opensciencelab/paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher'...
submodule path 'paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher': checked out '73475e6c19196a1af267ee36078a83f630d133db'
```

Running the status command again will show that the status of the
submodule has been update. The \"-\" is no longer present and git also
displays info about the branch.

``` shell
<adam@adls opensciencelab> (main)$git submodule status
 73475e6c19196a1af267ee36078a83f630d133db paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher (heads/main)
-8c974cc0352fa6a758556a39714848072939df96 paas/openldap/ansible/openldap
-7d2436fed86aa724e73068b71778ba527867be4d paas/storage/ansible/ceph
-209d26e06a31f355e2ecf9a3f0972bd94eb88e88 paas/storage/ansible/nfsv4
```

(heads/main) refers to the fact that the submodule is currently in a
headless state. How zen. This is the expected behavior for \`git
submodule update\`, which checks out the commit pointed to by the parent
module.

``` shell
<user@adls opensciencelab> (main)$ cd paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher/
<user@adls  osrancher> ((73475e6...))$
```

To make changes, create a new branch within the submodule:

``` shell
<user@adls osrancher> ((73475e6...))$ git switch -c feature/osrancher-improvement
Switched to a new branch 'feature/osrancher-improvement'
```

Let\'s say you want to add some useful info about the ansible workflow
used to deploy osrancher.

``` shell
<user@adls osrancher> (feature/osrancher-improvement)$echo "Some useful info." >> README.md
<user@adls osrancher> (feature/osrancher-improvement *)$git add README.md
<user@adls osrancher> (feature/osrancher-improvement +)$git commit -s -m"Added example for submodule workflow."
[feature/osrancher-improvement 53ef028] Added example for submodule workflow.
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Note that we haven\'t yet pushed these changes to a remote branch. To do
this, run:

``` shell
<user@adls osrancher> (feature/osrancher-improvement +)$git push origin feature/osrancher-improvement
```

Step back up into the parent module and run the git status command

``` shell
<user@adls ansible> (main *)$git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   osrancher (new commits)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Note that we are now again on the main branch of the opensciencelab
repository, the changes that we made to the submodule were not committed
to opensciencelab. The output of git diff will tell us more:

``` shell
<user@adls ansible> (main *)$git diff
diff --git a/paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher b/paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher
index 73475e6..53ef028 160000
--- a/paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher
+++ b/paas/k8s/ansible/osrancher
@@ -1 +1 @@
-Subproject commit 73475e6c19196a1af267ee36078a83f630d133db
+Subproject commit 53ef028371f9c8a3f7aced1cb8669bbdd87ed11f
```

From the perspective of opensciencelab, the singular change is the SHA-1
of the osrancher submodule.

Here we could create another short lived branch to stage the changes:

``` shell
<user@adls ansible> (main *)$git checkout 
Switched to a new branch 'feature/osrancher-improvement'
```

To stage the change to the SHA-1 of the osrancher submodule:

``` shell
<user@adls ansible> (feature/osrancher-improvement *)$git add osrancher
<user@adls ansible> (feature/osrancher-improvement +)$git commit -s -m"Update reference submodule flow."
<user@adls ansible> (feature/osrancher-improvement +)$git push origin feature/osrancher-improvement
```

That pretty much wraps up how you would make changes to code that would
run within the context of a deployment pipeline. If you are an open
source developer, or a researcher who is contributing a new application
to run, then this may be as far as you need to go. If you are an SRE or
member of the core team, you will want to read the next section to
understand how these changes are deployed into production.

# Pipeline workflow

## The view from the top

The opensciencecaas is the top level repository that contains all the
necessary source code needed to deploy clusters. The reason for keeping
this code in a separate repository like this is for security and to make
it easier to change cloud provider or CI/CD platform in the future, if
needs be. We also need the pipelines to run without exposing sensitive
data to the public.

Clone the repository and run the status command to see what submodules
it contains:

``` shell
<user@adls tuw>$git clone git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/AustrianDataLab/ADLS-CaaS/opensciencecaas
<user@adls tuw>$cd opensciencecaas/
<user@adls opensciencecaas> (main)$git submodule status
-d6cd8093d51f7ce0ff3f23cd4007681b29210c04 opensciencelab
```

Knowing what we now know about opensciencelab, we know that this
repository also contains submodules.
